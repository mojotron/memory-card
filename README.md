[Live preview](https://mojotron.github.io/memory-card/) of this project, hosted by Github Pages.

## How to play

This application puts your memory to the test. You are presented with multiple images of Pokemon. The images get shuffled every-time they are clicked. You CAN NOT click on any image more than once or else your score resets to zero. The main objective is to get the highest score as possible.

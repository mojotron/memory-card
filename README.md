# Memory Card Game

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-memory-card) curriculum. Goal of this project is to continue learning about React library. The main goal of this project is to use hooks or lifecycle methods as well as a lot of state.
The idea for this project comes from [this site](https://www.golangprograms.com/react-js-projects-for-beginners/memory-game-in-react-js.html). Itâ€™s a great resource for project ideas.

## How to play

This application puts your memory to the test. You are presented with multiple images of ???. The images get shuffled every-time they are clicked. You CAN NOT click on any image more than once or else your score resets to zero. The main objective is to get the highest score as possible.
